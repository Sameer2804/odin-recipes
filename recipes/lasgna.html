    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a very popular and traditional dish that is served through families 
        and generations over time. It is also my favorite food. As a pasta and meat lover, 
        the combination of pasta, meat, and rich cheeses is perfect. When I first consumed it, 
        it was almost like magic and as if heaven erupted in my mouth.

        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle 
        or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets 
        with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.

        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
        <li>250g beef mince</li>
        <li>250g pork mince</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>200ml beef stock</li>
        <li>200ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>150g pack mozzarella, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
